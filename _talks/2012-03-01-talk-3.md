I presented a tutorial on setting up a six degrees of freedom (6DOF) simulation in ANSYS Fluent. The latest version of Fluent enables such simulations without relying on user-defined functions (UDFs), which are often cumbersome and computationally inefficient. This tutorial was part of my Master’s applied project and is hosted on my advisor Dr. Jeonglae Kim’s YouTube channel, where it has received over 10,000 views.
