I gave a tutorial explaining how to set up a 6DOF simulation using the ANSYS Fluent. The current version of Fluent offers a means to do such simulations without requiring to couple via the user-defined function (UDF), which is cumbersome and a source of computational inefficiency. This work was a part of my Masters Applied project.
