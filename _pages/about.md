👋🏼 Hi! I'm Yagnik, a third year PhD student in the Mechanical Engineering department at Arizona State University. My research focuses on developing both classical and quantum machine learning techniques for predicting material properties and generating novel materials particularly in the areas of high-entropy alloys and thermoelectric materials.

======

Outside of research, I enjoy traveling, hiking, swimming, and playing chess. I also love reading, both fiction and non-fiction, in my free time. I'm currently reading Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami.
